AxisGTDSync is a sync server for [AxisGTD](https://github.com/magician333/AxisGTD), use Golang+[Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)

**ÔºÅThis server is experimental and it is not recommended to use him in a production environment.**


We may open up the official AxisGTD sync server in the future (not necessarily happening), but of course you can develop your own sync server for your own AxisGTD sync for better privacy.
